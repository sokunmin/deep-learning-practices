A repository that I use to take notes and practice deep learning programming.

# The notes include:

## Python 
* Fluent Python: Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming
* Python Tricks: A Buffet of Awesome Python Features

## TensorFlow
* Official TensorFlow tutorial/guides
* Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow (Book)
* Official TensorFlow github 

... to be added more.
